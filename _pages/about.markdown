Every once in a couple of months, or years, I make yet another attempt to set up a blog. That lingers for a couple of months and then fissles out.
This is yet another attempt in that category.
<p> I am an Engineering Manager by profession. As I figure out what that exactly means, I'll put down a few words here about my experiences in that area.
I might also write a few things about programming, tech culture, book and gadget reviews among the things that I dabble in.
In this age of voracious data and media consumption, this is an effort to produce.
